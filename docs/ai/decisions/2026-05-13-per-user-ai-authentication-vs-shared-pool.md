# Per-user AI authentication vs shared pool

**Context:** If Opencode ran on a shared server (Synology), all users would share one set of AI credentials.

**Decision:** Run the Opencode engine locally on each user's machine. Each user authenticates their own AI accounts.

**Consequences:**
- + No shared token pool to drain
- + Each user's credentials stay on their machine
- - Each user must set up their own AI account
